## Quantum Teleportation 

Quantum teleportation is the transfer of a particle's quantum state to another particle at a distant location, using quantum entanglement. By entangling two particles, measuring one, and sending the measurement results via classical communication, the state can be recreated at the destination without physically moving the particle. This process is key for quantum communication and computing but doesnâ€™t enable faster-than-light travel.

## This Project and its Goals

The goal of this project is to implement a quantum teleportation algorithm, using the qiskit SDK. It should serve to gain a deeper understanding of quantum teleportation, and to familiarize with qiskit.
